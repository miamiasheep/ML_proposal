  %\lipsum[1]
  Link prediction is one of the core problems of network-structure data. Some heuristic work pretty well in network kind of data such as katz index\cite{katz}, common neighbor, ... etc. However, there is seldom robust machine learning method be proposed. Because the heuristic method highly depends on the assumuption we make in the data set, it is not a general solution. What we want to do is propose a machine learning model that can work in the network-structured data. Recent years, there is some works focusing on these solutions. Zhang and Chen \cite{lpnn} \cite{wlnn} focused on solving these problems by enumerating nodes
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

Given two nodes in a graph. Link prediction is a task that to predict the probability whether there will be a link. It can benefit lots of application such as friend recommendation in social network, movie recommendation, and metabolic network reconstruction.

\subsection {Related Works}
There are already some existing works about link prediction. We organized these methods into three categories: Heuristics, latent feature models, and  enumerate nodes in a enclosed subgraph.

\subsection{Heuristic Method}
The most straight forward method is to design heuristics.
In network structured data, there are some famous heuristics to make prediction. 

\subsection {Latent Feature Model}
One of a successful solution is to train latent features for each node. One successful exmple is matrix factorzation. Matrix Factorization is a method that have a very good performance in the field of bipartite graph link prediction. Koren et al. proposed a matrix factorization \cite{mf} method minimizing square error and have a very good performance in terms of RMSE in the netflix competition. In 2012, Rendle et al. \cite{bprmf} proposed Bayesian Personalized Ranking to solve ranking problem while using matrix factorization. This methods achieve a very good result in link prediction in bipartite graph. However, these methods are specificially design for link prediction in bipartite graph. 

\subsection {enumerates node in a enclosed subgraph}
In 2017, Zhang et al. proposed a novel machine learning method. 


\section{Research Plan}
